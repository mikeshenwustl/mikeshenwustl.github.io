He is pursuing his PhD in energy, environmental &amp; chemical engineering at Washington University and plans to finish in the end of 2017. His research focuses on the fundamentals of spray pyrolysis in the application of nanostructured material synthesis, specifically on cathode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Mike has a diverse background in chemical engineering, inorganic and organic chemistry, process engineering, electrochemistry, and combustion science. He also participated in a couple of industrial/academic collaborations and successfully scales up the spray pyrolysis process to pilot scales. Mike was a summer intern at Monsanto Company where he worked in the Product Technology Group and assisted the innovation and optimization of the glyphosate manufacturing process.

Mike is also selected for McDonnell International Scholars Academy (MISA) and the recipient of Taiwan Ministry of Education Fellowship. MISA provides a unique platform to interact and learn from a diverse group of scholars with different cultural and academic background. Graduate students in various fields from 32 international partner universities learn and grow together through events and trips focusing on leaderships and collaborations.
