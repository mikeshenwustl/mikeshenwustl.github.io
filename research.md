**Graduate Research Assistant,** Washington University in Saint Louis              
**Ph.D. Thesis:**&quot;Low temperature flame spray pyrolysis for the synthesis of nanostructured electrochemical materials&quot;  
**Advisor:** Dr. Richard L. Axelbaum

Designed various spray pyrolysis approach for temperature sensitive electrochemical materials (LMR-NMC, Nickel-rich NMC, and sodium manganese oxides)

- Developed flow furnace, flame-assisted, direct flame, and slurry spray pyrolysis
- Tasks ranging from process design, reactor building, process control and optimization
- Collaborated with various industrial partners and scaled up spray pyrolysis process up to 350 gram/hours

Investigated and controlled particle formation during (flame) spray pyrolysis of battery materials

- Performed fundamental studies with piezoelectric-generated single droplet (~30 Âµm) and Hencken burner
- Observed the morphological change and particle formation mechanism of spray pyrolysis

Studied LMR-NMC and addressed capacity loss and voltage fades with spray pyrolysis

- Adopted trace level doping with alkali (Na, K, Rb, Cs), alkali earth (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) and Al
- Enhanced material stability, achieved higher voltage and reduced fade

Synthesized tunnel structure sodium manganese cathode material for sodium-ion batteries

- First to apply spray pyrolysis synthesis for rod-like sodium manganese oxides
-Optimized sodium/manganese ratio and achieved 95 % of the theoretical capacity

Developed unique titanium oxide spheres via spray pyrolysis for lithium-sulfur battery

-Hollow titanium oxide spheres served as protective shell to mitigate shuttling effect
